The AJAX-based Database Management System with Multiple Windows Project Viewing is a web appplication developed to aid the management of project data records easier and also help the comparison of two or more projects be more efficient.Inaddition, unlike the other existing systems, which only had one view for a project was available, this system could view upto 20 projects in a single web browser. However when the number of project view increases, the visibility of the content suffers , thus, the number of most desirable project window views was computed using the Criteria Matrix and the Pixel-based computation method. The two methods had the same results which leads to five concurrent project views in a browser.  Further, the access to the system could be limited to users for the confidentiality and security of the data.
